GitHub is a Git-based repository hosting platform with 26 million users (March 2017).
GitHub projects can be made public and every publicly shared code is freely open to everyone.
You can have private projects as well, but only 3 collaborators allowed on the free plan.
Public repositories on GitHub are often used to share open source software.
Besides the basic code repository, GitHub can be used for issue tracking, documentation, and wikis.
